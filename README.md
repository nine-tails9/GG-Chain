# HaXplore - Submission Report Format

This is the official code repository for Ctrl Alt Del Bitch . This _type of application_ was developed during HaXplore, 
the on-campus event conducted by Codefest, the annual departmental fest of Computer Science department, IIT BHU Varanasi.

#### Overview

We all know the classic tradeoff when building Machine Learning projects. It's cost vs time. If you want it fast, it's expensive as heck. Either you need to buy NVIDIA TPUs 2080 or wait for a lifetime before your model gets fully trained.

Imagine having the best of both worlds, a cheap yet quick method to train your model. GG-chain does a unique combination by incorporating the training of ML algorithms in the chaining process of a blockchain. This especially benefits the young Indian data scientists.

Our system is based on a crowdsourced model in which miners get paid by contributing into the training process of some ML model.

#### Technology used

Blockchain, Vue.JS, Flask, DynamoDb, Sqlite, Python, Boto3, Tensorflow



#### Usage

#### Run following commands to install depenedencies
```
    pip install json, boto3, tensorflowjs
    flask run
```
#### Now open flask server

#### Tracks used

Nurture the Future - The main idea is to help Indian students or literally anyone in the World, to achieve their model training faster and efficient. This idea directly targets students and developers who do not have access to credit cards or even spare money to implement the training on cloud services. This serves as a platform to those people and could also potentially disrupt the landscape of machine learning in the near future. 

#### AWS Services Used

We've user DynamoDb to store users requests for Model training and retreive those records on index page.
